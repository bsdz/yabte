r"""Heston Stochastic Volatility simulation.

Simulate stochastic process :math:`S_t` where,

.. math::

   d\nu_t = \kappa(\theta - \nu_t) dt + \xi \sqrt{\nu_t} dW_t^{\nu}

where :math:`\mu` is the drift, :math:`\nu_t` is the variance (volatility squared)
and :math:`dW_t^S`, :math:`dW_t^{\nu_t}` are Weiner processes. :math:`\theta` is long
term variance and :math:`\kappa` is mean reversion rate. :math:`xi` is volatility of
volatility.
